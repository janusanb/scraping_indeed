# scraping_indeed
This will be a project to review how to web scrape, using indeed

Future Goals:
*   Make it so it can search for any job not just "Tableau Developer" and in any location
*   Attempt to code the pagination portion, which just requires adding "start = 10"
*   Provide a way for people to put their own file name (if name == __main__ function should do this)
*   Provide "memory" which checks how old the previous version of the copy is and re-runs script based on that
*   Long-term create API through FLASK or other systems
